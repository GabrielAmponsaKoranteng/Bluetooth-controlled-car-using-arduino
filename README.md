# Bluetooth-controlled-car-using-arduino
This project focuses on creating a robot car that can be controlled using arduino bluetooth controller app(ANDRIOD OS only)
The control can be done by the use of the buttons or voice commands
The design of the robot was made possible by the use of a car chassis, 4 DC motors, motor driver, arduino-uno and 9-12V battery
The arduino-uno microprocessor works using the provided code in this repository(Projectwork.ino)
This seeks to solve the problem of the importation of robot cars and also serves as a prototype for a real life car that can be controlled without being behind the wheels.
